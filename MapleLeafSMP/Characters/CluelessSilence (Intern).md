### The Creator
Anxiety in a trench coat person who is the definition of insanity, but likes messing with code, science, art, writing, and research rabbit holes
### The Character
Intern is the only one who is aware of the fact that the others exist on a Minecraft server, tasked with the unfortunate task of keeping "insane gremlins who try to kill each other"(/pos) alive.
They mainly live in the console, and only appear in physical form to test or troubleshoot.
